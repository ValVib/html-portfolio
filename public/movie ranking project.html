<h1>The Best Movies to watch over and over again... According to Val.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<p>Who am I kidding? There are more because trilogies can't be left out.</p>


<hr />

<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>If you are a die-hard romantic like me and you love period films, this is one of the best recommendations I have for you.<br/>
Based on a Jane Austen novel, it doesn't disappoint with any of its characters. 
</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>If you like movies based on comics, with some action on it ad one of the best movieÂ´s director ever, you have to watch this.<br />
A masterpiece by Crhistopher Nolan with a perfect cast.<br />
What makes this movie perfect is that Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins sequel works wonders because he never saw it as a superhero film
</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings (including The Hobbit Movies)</h3>
<p>Finally we have a trilogy of fantasy movies, what makes it perfect is that you never get tired of it, because everythig is so well done that is just impossible not to watch every single one of them.<br />
But please do not forget to watch also The Hobbit, before LoTR, so you can understand everything a bit more.
